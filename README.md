Notes:

As the API used in this project is for trial, only one call is permitted each second and total amount of calls is limited to 200. Please be patient while starting our program, it may take about 1~2 min to call the API and retrieve back all the data needed. Also, each time running the program will use ~20 calls. Please do not run our little program frequently, otherwise we have to pay for it. Thank you very much!
